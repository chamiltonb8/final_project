# **Analyzing and Forecasting the Stock Market**
Here is how you use my package
## Overview
Here is the information for the stat386stonks package. This package implements a complete data science for analyzing historical stock market data using an Alpha Vantage API. The core functionality is packaged as a reusable python library, 'stat386stonks', which is used by both scripts and a Streamlit application. 

## Data Source

The data was collected from Alpha Vantage service using an API key to aquire the Weekly Ajusted Time Series endpoint. The data includes open, high, low, close, adjusted close, volume, and dividend variables. Accessing the API requires a free API key, which is stored locally. 

To access this API key, you'll need to visit the [Alpha Vantage Website](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)

## Overview

Here is the information for the stat386stonks package. This package implements a complete data science for analyzing historical stock market data using an Alpha Vantage API. The core functionality is packaged as a reusable python library, `stat386stonks`, which is used by both scripts and a Streamlit application. This package is designed to give stock information for those who want to know a bit more about the stock market and run simple analysis on that as well.  

## Installing the Package

In order to use this package, it needs to be installed. Below is how to do that in bash (terminal)

```{bash}
# Enter this into your terminal and it will load in the package. 
pip install git+https://github.com/chamiltonb8/final_project.git
```

Once the package has been installed, it can be imported into Python

```{python}
import stat386stonks
```

## Data Source

A very important part of this package is having access to the correct data. To access the data collected from the Alpha Vantage website using an API key to aquire the Weekly Ajusted Time Series data. The data includes open, high, low, close, adjusted close, volume, and dividend variables. Accessing the API requires a free API key, which is stored locally. 

To access this API key, you'll need to visit the [Alpha Vantage Website](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/). Once you've obtained the API key and placed it in a `.env` file and added that file to a `.gitignore` file, you should be able to continue with data collection and using the library.

When you've obtained your API key place it in your `.env` file like this (just make sure to replace "your_key_here" with the key you obtained):

```{python}
ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY = your_key_here
```

## Data Collection

All of the data collection is taken care of in the `read_data` module of the `stat386stonks` package. The functions in this module retrieve the weekly data for the Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Google, Amazon, Meta and the S&P 500. It will also return the results into a single Pandas DataFrame. Below is an example of how this works. 


```{python}
# Import the library and specific function used in data collection
from stat386stonks import fetch_weekly_adjusted 

# Specify the symbols you would like to use from the selected list. In this example we'll select all of them.
symbols = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "SPY", "TSLA", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "META"]

# Create a new dataframe using the function as demostrated
df_raw = fetch_weekly_adjusted(symbols)

# Save raw data (optional, recommended for reproducibility)
df_raw.to_csv("data/weekly_5yr_all_symbols.csv", index=False)
print(df_raw.head())

```




```{python3}


```

## **Introduction**
We created this package so that people can analyze historical data from some of the most well-known stocks, compare them to each other, and use models to predict what stock prices may be in the future. Predicting the stock market is a dream for almost everyone involved in investing. Knowing the future would allow investors to make immense profits. Although the predictive models we added do not give exact predictions and can be wrong, they provide insight into what future stock prices may look like based on historical data. We want to disclose that these models are not perfect, and one should not carelessly invest in the stocks included in our package solely based on our models.

## **Preparing the Data**
### **Acquiring the Data**

The dataset comes from the **Alpha Vantage API**, which provides publicly accessible financial market data, including historical and real-time prices for stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and forex. For this project, we only use historical stock prices. The data includes key information such as open, high, low, and close prices, trading volume, and adjusted close values for equities, along with metadata like the ticker symbol, time interval, and last refreshed date. The API allows data to be grouped by daily, weekly, or monthly intervals.

Accessing the API requires creating a free Alpha Vantage account, and data collection is legal as long as it is not used for commercial purposes and rate limits are respected. Because the free API has usage limits, we collected data in two stages: first retrieving five years of weekly data for seven stocks and saving it to a CSV file, then modifying the code to retrieve the next five years of data and saving it to a separate CSV file. These two CSV files were then combined into a single dataset, which we used for data cleaning. We also chose to use weekly data instead of daily data in order to maximize the amount of historical data we could obtain within the API’s free limits while still capturing meaningful trends.

### **Cleaning the Data**

Some data cleaning occurred during the process of combining the two CSV files. The column names originally contained numbers at the beginning, which we removed so that only the column names remained and were consistently capitalized. We also ensured that the data was sorted first by stock symbol and then by date so that time series plots would be accurate. Without this step, the graphs and analysis would not reflect the true trends in the data.

We added two new variables using information from the API. The first was *Close_diff*, which groups the data by stock and computes the difference in adjusted closing price between the current week and the previous week. The adjusted closing price accounts for events such as stock splits, which occurred for some of the stocks in our dataset and would otherwise distort the analysis.

The second variable we created was *Pct_Change*, which groups the data by stock and calculates the percent change in adjusted closing price relative to the first data point for that stock. This allows for better comparisons across stocks, as percent growth is more meaningful to investors than raw price levels.

## **Analysis**
### **Plotting**

When comparing adjusted closing prices across the stocks we analyzed, ordered from highest to lowest, the ranking is the *S&P 500, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, Google, Apple,* and *Amazon*. This ranking reflects prices as of approximately 12/1/25, when we last retrieved data from the API. This ordering is very similar to what it was ten years ago, with the main exception being *Tesla*, which rose from near the bottom to become the fourth-highest stock among the seven analyzed. The remaining stocks maintained similar rankings or were very close to one another.

The graphs also show a sizable decrease in stock prices from approximately 2022 to 2024. This decline aligns with a period of extremely high inflation driven by post-pandemic supply chain disruptions and strong consumer demand supported by earlier stimulus efforts.

Comparing stocks based on their percent change over the last ten years, all of them experienced substantial growth, with the lowest increase around 286% and the highest near 2700%. Ordered from highest to lowest growth over the ten-year period, the ranking is *Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta,* and the *S&P 500*. We were surprised to see that the *S&P 500* achieved only about half the growth of *Meta*, the second-lowest stock in this ranking. This result is reasonable, however, since the individual stocks analyzed are primarily technology companies that have experienced significant growth over the past decade, whereas the *S&P 500* represents a diversified index of the top 500 companies and is generally considered a safer, but still rewarding, investment.

### **Summary Tables**

We included summary tables to display numerical values for percent change, volatility, and the mean weekly percent increase for each stock.

Volatility measures how unpredictable a stock’s price movements are and provides insight into its risk level. Higher volatility indicates larger and more frequent price changes, while lower volatility suggests greater stability and potentially lower risk for long-term investors. From highest to lowest volatility, the stocks are *Amazon, Google, Tesla, Apple, Meta*, the *S&P 500*, and *Microsoft*. We were surprised that *Tesla* did not have the highest volatility, since the graphs show large price swings that visually appear very extreme. However, while *Tesla’s* volatility is still relatively high as the third most volatile stock, its value is around 95, compared to *Apple’s* volatility of only 18. We were also surprised to see that the *S&P 500*, often considered the safest long-term investment option, did not have the lowest volatility—*Microsoft* did. That said, the difference between their volatilities was less than one standard deviation, so they are not drastically different.

The final statistic we examined was the mean weekly percent increase in a stock’s closing price. This metric provides a long-term view of price trends and momentum while smoothing out some of the short-term “noise” present in the stock market. It helps estimate how much a stock might be expected to increase on an average week. This information can be useful for both short-term and long-term investors. A high average weekly increase may appeal to short- or medium-term investors, even if the stock is more volatile, while also offering reassurance to long-term investors that growth is occurring consistently over time.

## **Modeling**

## **Conclusion**

From our analysis, we found that *Tesla* experienced the largest increase over the past ten years among the seven stocks examined. Surprisingly, the *S&P 500* did not perform as strongly as expected when compared to major individual stocks such as *Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta*, and *Amazon*.

[Write about modeling]

This analysis could be improved by using daily stock prices instead of weekly prices; however, we were limited by the amount of data available through the free API. The study could also be expanded by including stocks outside of the *S&P 500*, or stocks that experienced extreme short-term gains followed by large losses, such as GameStop. Including a wider variety of stocks would provide a broader perspective, allow for deeper insights, and help make the predictive models more generalizable by better capturing market noise and volatility.
